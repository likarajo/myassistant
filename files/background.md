# AI Background

* AI could be more than a bunch of if statements.
* AI can be split into two fields - ***Symbolic AI***, and ***Machine Learning***.

## Symbolic AI

* Artificially intelligent systems designed with **if-else type logic**.
* Programmers attempt to **define every possible scenario** for the system to deal with.
Until the late seventies this was the dominant form of AI system development.
* Enormously impractical.

## Machine Learning

* Use statistics to **look for and define patterns in data**.
* Learn about and improve the tasks that it is designed to perform.
* Significantly more flexible.
